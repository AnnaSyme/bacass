## Introduction

This pipeline is for bacterial assembly of next-generation sequencing reads. It can be used to quality trim your reads using [Skewer](https://github.com/relipmoc/skewer) and performs basic QC using [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Afterwards, the pipeline performs read assembly using [Unicycler](https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler) and assesses assembly quality using [QUAST](http://bioinf.spbau.ru/quast). Contamination of the assembly is checked using [Kraken2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/) to verify sample purity. The resulting bacterial assembly is annotated using [Prokka](https://github.com/tseemann/prokka).

Furthermore, the pipeline creates various reports in the `results` directory specified, including a [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info) report summarizing some of the findings and software versions.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.
